"""Support-booking rules.

The one rule the school stated: **a student may only book a support teacher assigned to a
classroom that student is in.** Everything here exists to make that true and to keep it true
when someone leaves a class.

Eligibility is computed from live membership on every call rather than snapshotted onto the
booking. A student removed from a class stops being able to book its support teachers
immediately, which is the point — a snapshot would keep the door open until someone noticed.
